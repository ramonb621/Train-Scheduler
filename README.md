# Train-Scheduler
This assigment was designed as a way to determine when the next train would be arriving at the station if it started running at certain time at a designated rate.  The user can mess around with the train names and times to see when their desired train will be arriving at the station.

## Significance
This assignment allowed me to utilize momentJS while integrating a realtime firebase database to store and return stored data provided by the user.  This allowed me to kind of dip my toes into the water of real-world backend development.
